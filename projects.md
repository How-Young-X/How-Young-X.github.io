## How Chain-of-Thought works ?
This project focuses on LLMs Reasoning Analysis, exploring the mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning. Previous research primarily examined text-level differences and their impact on outputs. This study analyzes model behavior during CoT responses from three perspectives: <strong>decoding</strong>, <strong>activation</strong>, and <strong>projection</strong>. Notably, we found that during the decoding phase, the model effectively mimics and understands CoT prompts, demonstrating increased confidence and specificity in its responses. Compared to standard prompts, CoT prompts activate a broader range of knowledge acquired during pre-training.<br>
